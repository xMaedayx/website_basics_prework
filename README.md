## Installation

Establish a connection with gitlab and github by generating and adding the public ssh key to either platform. 
Create a new public repository with a readme file and a MIT license. Afterwards add the issues included with the creation of this simple website. The issues must include a user story and acceptance criteria. Clone the repository using the SSH link in the C.L.I.. Input repository into VSC. At this point a feature branch must be created to play with new code outside of the original code. Add commit message and use command to package the changes made for final merging of feature and base branch. Pull down any changes from the base branch. Push changes to the remote branch. In the web repo compare and pull the requested changes. Merge pull request. One at a time create feature branches that attend to HTML CSS Java and git. Check into main branch. Pull down latest main branch create new branch and save current work. Commit to repository and update current branch before pull request. Push changes. Go to browser repository and switch branches. Create new pull request and merge pull request. Repeat this process for each issue and mark off each issue as a merge is completed. Add sections to HTML to link to CSS style documents to create formatting. Link html document to java script document to add specifics about color and image sizes.  Deployment...

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
